# Sorting Algorithm Used

- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort

## Time Analysis

We can see from the time vs size graph below of both Insertion and Merge Sort that the merge sort is  much faster than insertion sort. It took 0.030 time for merge sort to sort data of size 1000 while it took insertion sort around 0.10 time which is almost 10 times slower.
