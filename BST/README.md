# Binary Search Tree Using OOP


Following operations are implemented:

- size(): Return the number of nodes in the tree.
- add(key, value) : Add a node to a BST.
- search(key): Search BST for the requested key and return the corresponding value. Must return False if the key does not exist.
- smallest(): Find the smallest key and return the key-value pair
(tuple).
- largest(): Find the largest key and return the key-value pair (tuple).
- remove(key): Delete a key from a BST. Must return False if the does not exist.
- inorder walk(): Inorder traversal. Must return a list of keys visitedin inorder way.
- preorder walk(): Preorder traversal. Must return a list of keys visited in preorder way.
- postorder walk(): Postorder traversal. Must return a list of keys visited in postorder way.
